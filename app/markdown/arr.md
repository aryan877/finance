---

**Once upon a time in the vibrant city of Jaipur, there lived two best friends, Aman and Riya. Both dreamed of making it big in the world of business. Aman wanted to open a café, while Riya was passionate about starting an online yoga subscription service. One evening, they met at their favorite tea stall to discuss their plans.**

## **Part 1: Aman's Journey with Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)**

### **Aman's Dream Café**

Aman excitedly shared, _"Riya, I've found the perfect espresso machine for my café! It costs **₹100,000**. But I'm worried—is it a good investment?"_

Riya smiled, _"Let's figure it out together! We can use the **Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)** to see if it's worthwhile."_

### **Understanding Accounting Rate of Return**

Riya explained, _"The Accounting Rate of Return helps you understand how much profit you'll make each year compared to your initial investment. The formula is simple:"_

$$
\text{ARR} = \left( \frac{\text{Average Annual Profit}}{\text{Initial Investment}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

### **Calculating Aman's ARR**

**Expected Additional Profits from the Espresso Machine:**

- **Year 1:** ₹30,000
- **Year 2:** ₹35,000
- **Year 3:** ₹40,000
- **Year 4:** ₹45,000
- **Year 5:** ₹50,000

**Step 1: Total Profit Over 5 Years**

_"First, let's add up the profits,"_ Riya suggested.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Total Profit} &= ₹30,000 + ₹35,000 + ₹40,000 + ₹45,000 + ₹50,000 \\
&= \textbf{₹200,000}
\end{align*}
$$

Aman’s eyes sparkled. _"Wow, that's a lot!"_

**Step 2: Average Annual Profit**

_"Now, we find the average yearly profit,"_ Riya continued.

$$
\text{Average Annual Profit} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Number of Years}} = \frac{₹200,000}{5} = \textbf{₹40,000}
$$

**Step 3: Calculating ARR**

_"Finally, we calculate the ARR,"_ she said.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{ARR} &= \left( \frac{₹40,000}{₹100,000} \right) \times 100\% \\
&= 0.4 \times 100\% \\
&= \textbf{40\%}
\end{align*}
$$

Aman grinned from ear to ear. _"A 40% return each year sounds fantastic!"_

### **What This Means for Aman**

Riya concluded, _"An ARR of 40% means you're earning back 40% of your investment every year on average. It's a strong indicator that buying the espresso machine is a good investment."_

Aman felt a surge of confidence. _"Thank you, Riya! Now I can proceed with my café plans without hesitation."_

## **Part 2: Riya's Adventure with Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**

### **Riya's Online Yoga Classes**

Now it was Riya's turn to share. _"Aman, I'm launching online yoga classes. Subscribers will pay monthly fees. But I'm unsure how to predict my annual income."_

Aman nodded thoughtfully. _"We can calculate your **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** to estimate your yearly earnings."_

### **Understanding Annual Recurring Revenue**

_"ARR is the total revenue you expect from all your subscribers in a year. The formula is:"_

$$
\text{ARR} = \text{Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)} \times 12
$$

### **Calculating Riya's ARR**

**Current Subscribers:**

- **Subscriber 1:** Pays ₹500 per month
- **Subscriber 2:** Pays ₹1,000 per month
- **Subscriber 3:** Pays ₹1,500 per month

**Step 1: Calculate Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{MRR} &= ₹500 + ₹1,000 + ₹1,500 \\
&= \textbf{₹3,000}
\end{align*}
$$

**Step 2: Calculate Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{ARR} &= \text{MRR} \times 12 \\
&= ₹3,000 \times 12 \\
&= \textbf{₹36,000}
\end{align*}
$$

Riya felt a wave of excitement. _"So, I can expect ₹36,000 this year if I maintain my subscribers!"_

**Step 3: Adjusting for Growth**

_"But wait,"_ she added, _"I'm planning a marketing campaign and expect to gain 5 more subscribers, each paying ₹1,000 per month."_

**New MRR:**

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{New MRR} &= \text{Existing MRR} + (\text{New Subscribers} \times \text{Monthly Fee}) \\
&= ₹3,000 + (5 \times ₹1,000) \\
&= ₹3,000 + ₹5,000 \\
&= \textbf{₹8,000}
\end{align*}
$$

**New ARR:**

$$
\text{New ARR} = ₹8,000 \times 12 = \textbf{₹96,000}
$$

Riya's eyes widened. _"Almost ₹1,00,000 a year! This is beyond what I imagined!"_

### **What This Means for Riya**

Aman cheered, _"This means your business has great potential. Knowing your ARR helps you set goals and make plans for growth."_

Riya felt motivated. _"Absolutely! Now I can plan for better equipment and perhaps hire another instructor."_
